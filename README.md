Markdown typos are possible due to many entries being converted from other formats. Feel free to create an issue!

**Beware Github sanitizes Markdown before converting it to HTML so some formatting in the texts is lost when viewing from this repoâ€™s Github page and not through other means.** Details lost nclude `abbr title` which is used to append hints and snarky inline comments, and small styling to make verses inside prose look more at home.
